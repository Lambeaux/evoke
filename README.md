# Evoke
Affective computing framework and processing server for real-time adaptive behavior and analysis with regard to simulation and video games. Can be extended to a variety of domains. 

### Features

* Wrap emerging APIs from bioinformatics companies offering detection hardware
* Define multiple schemas for measuring affect and handle the conversions to a schema of choice
* Interact with a central ontology that defines families of actions for analysis against raw data
* Manage an intelligent and adaptive agent that's responsible for issuing commands to achieve specified results
* Boot up an affect container that can talk to and enhance live simulation
* Use modern machine learning techniques to optimize the adaptive solution
* Interface with a variety of NoSQL databases using a simple facade system and service provider
* Link the platform to the cloud when projects start to scale

### Contribute

Software engineers, data scientists, game developers, and mathematicians are all needed to move the system forward. Plans in the forseeable future involve a set of plug-ins for interfacing with popular game engines found in the indie community.
